This package provides the `@Query` property wrapper, that lets your SwiftUI views automatically update their content when the database changes.

```swift
import GRDBQuery
import SwiftUI

/// A view that displays an always up-to-date list of players in the database.
struct PlayerList: View {
    @Query(PlayerRequest())
    var players: [Player]
    
    var body: some View {
        List(players) { player in
            Text(player.name)
        }
    }
}
```

`@Query` is for [GRDB] what [`@FetchRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fetchrequest) is for Core Data. Although `@Query` does not depend on GRDB, it was designed with GRDB in mind.

## Why @Query?

**`@Query` solves a tricky SwiftUI challenge.** It makes sure SwiftUI views are *immediately* rendered with the database content you expect.

For example, when you display a `List` that animates its changes, you do not want to see an animation for the *initial* state of the list, or to prevent this undesired animation with extra code.

You also want your SwiftUI previews to display the expected values *without having to run them*.

Techniques based on [`onAppear(perform:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onappear(perform:)), [`onReceive(_:perform)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/onreceive(_:perform:)) and similar methods suffer from this "double-rendering" problem and its side effects. By contrast, `@Query` has you fully covered.

## Thanks

ðŸ™Œ `@Query` was vastly inspired from [Core Data and SwiftUI](https://davedelong.com/blog/2021/04/03/core-data-and-swiftui/) by [@davedelong](https://github.com/davedelong), with [a critical improvement](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/pull/955) contributed by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete). Many thanks to both of you!
